                <p class="text-danger semi-bold"> Odor source localization by multiple mobile agents- A cooperative control approach</p>
                In last couple of decades, there has been tremendous developments in the area of robot olfaction addressing challenges such as early detection of forest fire, oil spills, release of toxic gases in tunnels and mines, gas leaks
                in industrial setup, search and rescue of victims and clearing leftover mine after an armed conflict. While behavior of biological entities such as mate seeking by moths, foraging by lobsters, prey tracking by mosquitoes and blue crabs, etc., have long been imitated in simple and complex algorithms for olfaction problems; techniques such as probabilistic inference, robust control, swarm intelligence, optimization and meta-heuristics prove more effective in the problem of odor source localization. An odor plume containing filaments, or odor molecules, is generally referred to the downwind trail formed as a consequence of mixing of contaminant molecules in any kind of movement of air. Odor source localization is a three stage problem- instantaneous plume sensing, robot(s) maneuvering, and control of the robot(s). While many literatures have been reported on
                plume sensing and robot maneuvering, only a few have addressed the issue of odor source localization using cooperative control standpoint. The dynamical optimization problem of odor source localization can be effectively solved using multiple robots working in cooperation. The obvious advantages of leveraging multi agent systems (MAS) are increased probability of success, redundancy, improved overall operational efficiency and spatial diversity in having distributed sensing and actuation.

                <p>The distributed cooperative control of Multi- Agent Systems (MAS) has drawn attention of diverse research community due to its potential applications in commercial and defense, such as Unmanned Air Vehicles for search and rescue operations, Autonomous underwater vehicles for search and source localization, mobile robot systems formation, intelligent transportation systems, attitude alignment of spacecrafts, cooperative attack of multiple missiles, wireless sensor networks, etc. A small perturbation in a single agent can adversely affect the entire interconnected network of MAS. Contrary to a single autonomous agent, MAS provides higher degree of redundancy and improvement on operational efficiency. Moreover, MAS exploits the advantage of having distributed sensing and actuation. A particularly challenging problem in this field is commonly referred to as consensus. A consensus algorithm or protocol is an interaction rule that specifies the information exchange between an agent and all of its neighbors on the network. The objective of MAS consensus is to devise a network distributed control algorithm such that all agents reach an agreement on certain quantities of interest via local interaction. A group of autonomous agents should possess the ability to interact amongst themselves or with their environments and are required to accomplish some specified task together as a single entity to reach a common goal. Agents could be homogeneous, i.e., their dynamics are identical, or heterogeneous, i.e., dynamics of each agent is different. Heterogeneous agents are of relatively higher practical significance than their homogeneous counterparts. Another interesting and challenging problem in this area is referred to as formation control of MAS. The objective of formation control is to move the agents cohesively in a specified geometrical pattern to perform a cooperative task. The obvious advantages of having achieved formation of MAS are high probability of success, cost and energy efficiency, robustness, accuracy and increased feasibility.

                With the advancement of embedded systems, almost all the controllers are realized in sampled data approach owing to their easier implementations. Therefore, the practical approach to solve leader follower consensus problem is to use sampled data control especially in bandwidth and energy constrained environments. The traditional sampled data control system considers periodic update of the controllers even after achieving control objective. The measurements are sampled and control is updated periodically even if the system may tolerate fluctuations in some allowable range. This results in wastage of significant computational and communication resources. An efficient way to reduce communication and computational burden is to use event triggering scheme. The samples are obtained only when an event is triggered. The objective of the event triggering scheme is to sample and update controller only when the local measurement error crosses a predefined threshold while ensuring satisfactory closed loop performance of the system.
